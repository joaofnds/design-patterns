/*
 * The iterator pattern provides you with a uniform way to access different collections of Object
 * If you get an Array, ArrayList and Hashtable of Object, you pop out an iterator for each and treat them the same
 * This provides a uniform way to cycle through different collections
 * You can also write polymorphic code because you can refer to each collection of objects because they'll implement the same interface
